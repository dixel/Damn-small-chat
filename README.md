#Damn small chat.
_simple console chat written on Node.Js_
##1. Usage:
Change "localhost" on serv.js and client.js to your server domain name.  
On server start serv.js and on client machines start client.js.
The client.js script is just a simple console chat.
##2. Web chat:
To start web-chat on your server run test.js script with page.html on folder. You should type in test.js new server adress and http port for web-server.
First time you'll be prompted for nickname. After that you'll be on a chat. That's all.  
This is the example of how simple socket programs can be done with node.js.
